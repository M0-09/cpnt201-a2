My Fav Sport Is Basketball

A Canadian who moved to the US invented basketball.

Basketball is also a very good sport for physical exercise.

I try and play basketball whenever I can find some time to kill.

You get points by scoring a basket; one get different number of points after shooting from different areas of the court.
